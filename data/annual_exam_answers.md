   | Element | Atomic Number | Number of Protons | Number of Electrons | Number of Neutrons |
   |---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
   | Hydrogen| 1            | 1                 | 1                   | 0                 |
   | Helium  | 2            | 2                 | 2                   | 2                 |

(b) Atomic structure and chemical behavior:
   - Valence electrons determine reactivity
   - Elements with full outer shells are stable (noble gases)
   - Elements with 1-3 valence electrons tend to lose them
   - Elements with 5-7 valence electrons tend to gain electrons
   - Examples:
     * Helium (2): Stable, unreactive
     * Sodium (2,8,1): Loses 1 electron
     * Chlorine (2,8,7): Gains 1 electron
